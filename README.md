# RubikCube
Rubik's Cube Solver using A* Algorithm in Java

This is a Java program that solves Rubik's Cube using the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm is an informed search algorithm that uses heuristic functions to estimate the cost of the optimal solution. This program uses the A* algorithm to search for the shortest sequence of moves required to solve the cube.
